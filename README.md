# CS510Project

Before Running Code
1. Install "ggplot2", "dplyr", and "reshape2" packages.
2. Download "owid-covid-data.csv", "AAPL.csv", and "MSFT.csv"


By running the entire project, 2 graphs will be produce. The first will show the percentage in closing prices of Apple and Microsoft stocks respectively, and the second will show the percentage change in new cases. There is then a linear analysis between the percent of new cases and the closing price of each stock, Apple and Microsoft. 

The R-Squared values for these graphs are substantially low, both less than 0.02. From this, I have concluded that there is not sufficent information to say that the COVID-19 outbreak is the sole reason for the instability of the dow. Although it may be a large part of the instability, other factors must have held a larger role in the market. The further graphs show the residuals for both rendered models with both showing somewhat random and inconsisitent errors across the board.

Further research on this now historical event can include other variables, such as new products, restrictions put in place, and perhaps spending power per capita to have a more accurate model. Since all of these were greatly changed throughout the outbreak, it could prove useful in determining a relationship to the stock market.
